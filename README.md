## Usage
Nothing is easier than running this application.  It's the greatest syntax ever, believe me!
```bash
# ./trumpatron.py
``` 

### Customizing Application
A configuration file is used by the application for various settings, mostly related to Twitter API authentication.
It's located at `conf/main.cfg`. Open the file to take a look at the various settings and customize them to your liking.

# What is this?
The @trumpatron1 Twitter account is a mock account ran by this bot. At a regular interval, this bot runs, fetches 
the most recent @realdonaldtrump tweets, and mixes statements from those tweets together to create a new, original Tweet.

After being generated, it's tweeted to the @trumpatron1 account.
